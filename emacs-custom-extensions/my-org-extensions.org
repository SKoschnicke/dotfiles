* Introduction

This file contains custom org-mode extensions to enhance productivity with org-mode in Emacs.
The file is set up to automatically tangle to =my-org-extensions.el= when saved.

* Auto-Tangle Configuration

This section contains the code that enables automatic tangling whenever this file is saved.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Auto-tangle on save
(defun org-babel-auto-tangle ()
  "Automatically tangle org file when saved."
  (when (eq major-mode 'org-mode)

* Jira Integration

Functions and key bindings for interacting with Jira from org-mode.

** Open Jira Ticket at Point

This function looks for Jira ticket references in the current org section and
opens them in a browser. I normally add a link to the ticket or a tag in the
form =FP_1234= to the heading, but I want to be able to open the ticket in Jira
from anywhere in the section.

Press ˜SPC m j˜ to invoke the function.

This lets me copy anything from org mode formatted for Slack to the clipboard. Press Ctrl Shift F (Linux/Windows) or ⌘ Shift F (Mac) to apply formats.

I often put links to Slack conversations into my org-mode notes. These links go through the browser to open the linked item in the Slack.app, which is slow. The following code directly opens the item in the Slack.app.

Usage instructions:
1. Run M-x slack-setup-team-id to configure your team ID
2. Or manually set: (setq slack-team-id "T12345678")
3. Your existing Slack links in org-mode will now open in the Slack app

To find your team ID:
- Go to your Slack workspace in a browser
- Check the URL or workspace settings
- It usually starts with 'T' followed by numbers/letters

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

* Git Integration

Functions for automating Git operations from org-mode.

** Auto-commit with Day Name

This function automatically commits all changes in the current repository and pushes them,
using the current day name (e.g., "Monday") as the commit message.

I end the work day with committing and pushing the org files to a Git repository
(I sync using that way). While it is fast using magit directly, I can automate
it. Then I don't have to type the commit message every time.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  "Commit all changes and push with the current day name as commit message."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((day-names '("Sunday" "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"))
         (current-day (nth (string-to-number (format-time-string "%w")) day-names))
         (default-directory (or (magit-toplevel) default-directory)))

** Checkout branch belonging to current todo
[2025-04-07 Mon 10:29]

* Utility Functions

Other utility functions for working with org mode.

** Add arbitrary text to refile.org

use it together with Raycast to quickly capture todos when not in emacs.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/add-to-refile (text)
  "Add TEXT to the refile.org file."
  (save-window-excursion

    (insert "\n")
    (insert text)
    (save-buffer)))
#+end_src

** Add executables to exec-path

This ensures Emacs can find essential executables by using whereis to locate them and
adding them to the exec-path. I need this on NixOS because everything else I tried
didn't work.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/add-executable-to-exec-path (executable)
    "Find EXECUTABLE using whereis and add its directory to exec-path."
    (let* ((whereis-output (shell-command-to-string (concat "whereis " executable)))
           (exec-file-path (when (string-match (concat "/" "[^ ]+" "/" executable) whereis-output)
                             (match-string 0 whereis-output))))
      (when exec-file-path
        (let ((exec-dir (file-name-directory exec-file-path)))
          (add-to-list 'exec-path exec-dir)
          (message "Added %s to exec-path" exec-dir)))))

** Fix lsp mode for PHP
[2025-06-02 Mon 14:53]

Even though I configured lsp for PHP, I always manually have to ~M-x lsp~ when
opening a PHP buffer. This snipped fixes it by enabling lsp mode after a buffer
became visible (it doesn't work to add it to the php-mode-hook, likely because
that is too early).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-enable-lsp-for-visible-php-buffers (frame)
    "Enable LSP mode for visible PHP buffers that don't have it active."
    (dolist (window (window-list frame))

        (when (and (derived-mode-p 'php-mode)
                   (not (bound-and-true-p lsp-mode)))

** Automatically insert date after inserted headings in org-mode

This helps tracking when I created todos and headings. I have this toggleable because when I'm structuring a task and creating many sub-tasks, adding a date is more of a distraction. Also when creating presentations, I don't want a date in every slide.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Toggle for inserting dates after created headers
  (defvar my/org-auto-insert-created-date t
    "When non-nil, automatically insert creation date into new org headings.")

  (defun my/toggle-org-auto-insert-created-date ()
    "Toggle automatic insertion of creation dates in org headings."

    (setq my/org-auto-insert-created-date (not my/org-auto-insert-created-date))
    (message "The Chronicles of Creation %s"
             (if my/org-auto-insert-created-date "pulse with power" "lie dormant")))

  ;; Function to insert date after created headers
  (defun my/insert-created-date (&rest ignore)
    "Insert creation date into org heading if `my/org-auto-insert-created-date' is non-nil."
    (when my/org-auto-insert-created-date
      (insert "\n")
      (org-insert-time-stamp (current-time) 't 't)
      (org-back-to-heading) ;; in org-capture, this folds the entry; when inserting a heading, this moves point back to the heading line
      (move-end-of-line))) ;; when inserting a heading, this moves point to the end of the line

* Org-Edna extensions

Add a trigger to a heading like this:

And have a named babel block in the content.

*** org-ql documentation which needs to be provided to the LLM
[2025-09-23 Tue 17:24]

Not yet sure how to, but LLM does use the predicates wrong otherwise. I added the time predicates, it's a bit better now.

**** General predicates

Arguments are listed next to predicate names, where applicable.

+  =blocked= :: Return non-nil if current heading is blocked.  Calls ~org-entry-blocked-p~, which see.
+  =category (&rest categories)= :: Return non-nil if current heading is in one or more of ~CATEGORIES~ (a list of strings).
+  =done= :: Return non-nil if entry's ~TODO~ keyword is in ~org-done-keywords~.
+  =effort (&optional effort-or-comparator effort)= :: Return non-nil if current heading's effort property matches arguments.  The following forms are accepted: ~(effort DURATION)~: Matches if effort is ~DURATION~.  ~(effort DURATION DURATION)~: Matches if effort is between DURATIONs, inclusive.  ~(effort COMPARATOR DURATION)~: Matches if effort compares to ~DURATION~ with ~COMPARATOR~.  ~COMPARATOR~ may be ~<~, ~<=~, ~>~, or ~>=~.  ~DURATION~ should be an Org effort string, like =5= or =0:05=.
+  =habit= :: Return non-nil if entry is a habit.
+  =heading (&rest strings)= :: Return non-nil if current entry's heading matches all ~STRINGS~.  Matching is done case-insensitively.
     -  Aliases: =h=.
+  ~heading-regexp (&rest regexps)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry's heading matches all ~REGEXPS~ (regexp strings).  Matching is done case-insensitively.
     -  Aliases: ~h*~.
+  =level (level-or-comparator &optional level)= :: Return non-nil if current heading's outline level matches arguments.  The following forms are accepted: ~(level NUMBER)~: Matches if heading level is ~NUMBER~.  ~(level NUMBER NUMBER)~: Matches if heading level is equal to or between NUMBERs.  ~(level COMPARATOR NUMBER)~: Matches if heading level compares to ~NUMBER~ with ~COMPARATOR~.  ~COMPARATOR~ may be ~<~, ~<=~, ~>~, or ~>=~.
+  =link (&optional description-or-target &key description target regexp-p)= :: Return non-nil if current heading contains a link matching arguments. ~DESCRIPTION-OR-TARGET~ is matched against the link's description and target.  Alternatively, one or both of ~DESCRIPTION~ and ~TARGET~ may be matched separately.  Without arguments, return non-nil if any link is found.
+  =outline-path (&rest strings)= :: Return non-nil if current node's outline path matches all of ~STRINGS~.  Each string may appear as a substring in any part of the node's outline path.  For example, the path =Food/Fruits/Grapes= would match ~(olp "Fruit" "Grape")~.
     -  Aliases: ~olp~.
+  =outline-path-segment (&rest strings)= :: Return non-nil if current node's outline path matches ~STRINGS~.  Matches ~STRINGS~ as a contiguous segment of the outline path.  Each string is compared as a substring.  For example the path ~Food/Fruits/Grapes~ would match ~(olps "Fruit" "Grape")~ but not ~(olps "Food" "Grape")~.
     -  Aliases: ~olps~.
+  =path (&rest regexps)= :: Return non-nil if current heading's buffer's filename path matches any of ~REGEXPS~ (regexp strings).  Without arguments, return non-nil if buffer is file-backed.
+  =priority (&rest args)= :: Return non-nil if current heading has a certain priority.  ~ARGS~ may be either a list of one or more priority letters as strings, or a comparator function symbol followed by a priority letter string.  For example:  ~(priority "A") (priority "A" "B") (priority '>= "B")~ Note that items without a priority cookie never match this predicate (while Org itself considers items without a cookie to have the default priority, which, by default, is equal to priority ~B~).
+  =property (property &optional value &key inherit)= :: Return non-nil if current entry has ~PROPERTY~ (a string), and optionally ~VALUE~ (a string).  If ~INHERIT~ is nil, only match entries with ~PROPERTY~ set on the entry; if t, also match entries with inheritance.  If ~INHERIT~ is not specified, use the value of ~org-use-property-inheritance~, which see.
+  =regexp (&rest regexps)= :: Return non-nil if current entry matches all of ~REGEXPS~ (regexp strings).  Matches against entire entry, from beginning of its heading to the next heading.
     -  Aliases: =r=.
+  =rifle (&rest strings)= :: Return non-nil if each string is found in either the entry or its outline path.  Works like =org-rifle=.  This is probably the most useful, intuitive, general-purpose predicate.
     - Aliases: ~smart~.
     - *Note:* By default, this is the default predicate used for plain-string query tokens (i.e. given without a specified predicate).  This can be customized with the option ~org-ql-default-predicate~.
+  ~src (&key lang regexps)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry contains an Org Babel source block.  If ~LANG~ is non-nil, match blocks of that language.  If ~REGEXPS~ is non-nil, require that block's contents match all regexps.  Matching is done case-insensitively.
+  =tags (&rest tags)= :: Return non-nil if current heading has one or more of ~TAGS~ (a list of strings).  Tests both inherited and local tags.
+  =tags-inherited (&rest tags)= :: Return non-nil if current heading's inherited tags include one or more of ~TAGS~ (a list of strings).  If ~TAGS~ is nil, return non-nil if heading has any inherited tags.
     -  Aliases: ~inherited-tags~, ~tags-i~, ~itags~.
+  =tags-local (&rest tags)= :: Return non-nil if current heading's local tags include one or more of ~TAGS~ (a list of strings).  If ~TAGS~ is nil, return non-nil if heading has any local tags.
     -  Aliases: ~local-tags~, ~tags-l~, ~ltags~.
+  =tags-all (&rest tags)= :: Return non-nil if current heading includes all of ~TAGS~.  Tests both inherited and local tags.
     -  Aliases: ~tags&~.
+  =tags-regexp (&rest regexps)= :: Return non-nil if current heading has tags matching one or more of ~REGEXPS~.  Tests both inherited and local tags.
     -  Aliases: ~tags*~.
+  =todo (&rest keywords)= :: Return non-nil if current heading is a ~TODO~ item.  With ~KEYWORDS~, return non-nil if its keyword is one of ~KEYWORDS~ (a list of strings).  When called without arguments, only matches non-done tasks (i.e. does not match keywords in ~org-done-keywords~).

**** Ancestor/descendant predicates

+  =ancestors (&optional query)= :: Return non-nil if current heading has ancestor headings.  If ~QUERY~, return non-nil if an ancestor heading matches it.  This selector may be nested.
+  =children (&optional query)= :: Return non-nil if current heading has direct child headings.  If ~QUERY~, return non-nil if a child heading matches it.  This selector may be nested, e.g. to match grandchild headings.
+  =descendants (&optional query)= :: Return non-nil if current heading has descendant headings.  If ~QUERY~, return non-nil if a descendant heading matches it.  This selector may be nested (if you can grok the nesting!).
+  =parent (&optional query)= :: Return non-nil if current heading has a direct parent heading.  If ~QUERY~, return non-nil if the parent heading matches it.  This selector may be nested, e.g. to match grandparent headings.

**** Date/time predicates

These predicates take optional keyword arguments:

+  ~:from~: Match entries whose timestamp is on or after timestamp ~:from~.
+  ~:to~: Match entries whose timestamp is on or before timestamp ~:to~.
+  ~:on~: Match entries whose timestamp is on date ~:on~.
+  ~:with-time~: If unspecified, match timestamps with or without times (i.e. HH:MM).  If nil, match timestamps without times.  If t, match timestamps with times.

Timestamp/date arguments should be either a number of days (positive to look forward, or negative to look backward), a string parseable by ~parse-time-string~ (the string may omit the time value), the symbol ~today~, or a ~ts~ struct.

+  *Predicates*
     -  =ts= :: Return non-nil if current entry has a timestamp in given period.  Without arguments, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp.
     -  =ts-active=, =ts-a= :: Like =ts=, but only matches active timestamps.
     -  =ts-inactive=, =ts-i= :: Like =ts=, but only matches inactive timestamps.

The following predicates, in addition to the keyword arguments, can also take a single argument, a number, which looks backward or forward a number of days.  The number can be negative to invert the direction.

These two predicates interpret a single number argument as if it were passed to the ~:from~ keyword argument, which eases the common case of searching for items clocked or closed in the past few days:

+  *Backward-looking*
     -  =clocked= :: Return non-nil if current entry was clocked in given period.  Without arguments, return non-nil if entry was ever clocked.  Note: Clock entries are expected to be clocked out.  Currently clocked entries (i.e. with unclosed timestamp ranges) are ignored.
     -  =closed= :: Return non-nil if current entry was closed in given period.  Without arguments, return non-nil if entry is closed.

These predicates interpret a single number argument as if it were passed to the ~:to~ keyword argument, which eases the common case of searching for items planned in the next few days:

+  *Forward-looking*
     -  =deadline= :: Return non-nil if current entry has deadline in given period.  If argument is =auto=, return non-nil if entry has deadline within =org-deadline-warning-days=.  Without arguments, return non-nil if entry has any deadline.
     -  =planning= :: Return non-nil if current entry has planning timestamp (i.e. its deadline, scheduled, or closed timestamp) in given period.  Without arguments, return non-nil if entry has any planning timestamp.
     -  =scheduled= :: Return non-nil if current entry is scheduled in given period.  Without arguments, return non-nil if entry is scheduled.

* Inline Preview for Source File Links
[2025-11-27 Wed]

This provides an inline preview of source files linked in org-mode. When preview mode is enabled, shows a preview automatically when the cursor is on a file link.

Features:
- Shows preview of linked source files with syntax highlighting
- Supports file links with line numbers (e.g., [[file:path.py::42]])
- Shows context around the specified line or first N lines of file
- Automatic preview when cursor is on a link (when mode is enabled)
- Efficient: only one preview shown at a time

* Provide statement (needs to be at the end!)

The provide statement must match the symbol you use in require
It should be the last line of executable code in your file
The feature name (symbol) should match your filename: =my-org-extensions.el= provides ~'my-org-extensions~

** Why This System Exists

This prevents infinite loops and ensures modules are only loaded once. When you require a feature:

- If it's already loaded, Emacs does nothing
- If not loaded, Emacs finds and loads the file that provides it
- The provide statement marks it as successfully loaded

Without the provide statement, Emacs doesn't know that your file actually provides the requested feature, so require fails.
