* Introduction

This file contains custom org-mode extensions to enhance productivity with org-mode in Emacs.
The file is set up to automatically tangle to =my-org-extensions.el= when saved.

* Auto-Tangle Configuration

This section contains the code that enables automatic tangling whenever this file is saved.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Auto-tangle on save
(defun org-babel-auto-tangle ()
  "Automatically tangle org file when saved."
  (when (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
    (let ((org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil))

* Jira Integration

Functions and key bindings for interacting with Jira from org-mode.

** Open Jira Ticket at Point

This function looks for Jira ticket references in the current org section and
opens them in a browser. I normally add a link to the ticket or a tag in the
form =FP_1234= to the heading, but I want to be able to open the ticket in Jira
from anywhere in the section.

Press ˜SPC m j˜ to invoke the function.

This lets me copy anything from org mode formatted for Slack to the clipboard. Press Ctrl Shift F (Linux/Windows) or ⌘ Shift F (Mac) to apply formats.

I often put links to Slack conversations into my org-mode notes. These links go through the browser to open the linked item in the Slack.app, which is slow. The following code directly opens the item in the Slack.app.

Usage instructions:
1. Run M-x slack-setup-team-id to configure your team ID
2. Or manually set: (setq slack-team-id "T12345678")
3. Your existing Slack links in org-mode will now open in the Slack app

To find your team ID:
- Go to your Slack workspace in a browser
- Check the URL or workspace settings
- It usually starts with 'T' followed by numbers/letters

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

* Git Integration

Functions for automating Git operations from org-mode.

** Auto-commit with Day Name

This function automatically commits all changes in the current repository and pushes them,
using the current day name (e.g., "Monday") as the commit message.

I end the work day with committing and pushing the org files to a Git repository
(I sync using that way). While it is fast using magit directly, I can automate
it. Then I don't have to type the commit message every time.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-git-commit-day ()
  "Commit all changes and push with the current day name as commit message."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((day-names '("Sunday" "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"))

** Checkout branch belonging to current todo

This generates statistics about how many tasks I completed at this day and how
many new tasks were created. That lets me keep an eye on getting the number of
active tasks down. It can be added to capture template for reviews:

* Utility Functions

Other utility functions for working with org mode.

** Add arbitrary text to refile.org

This can be called from an external script to append things to my refile.org. I
use it together with Raycast to quickly capture todos when not in emacs.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/add-to-refile (text)
  "Add TEXT to the refile.org file."
  (save-window-excursion
    (find-file (concat my-org-file-path "/refile.org"))
    (goto-char (point-max))
    (insert "\n")
    (insert text)
    (save-buffer)))
#+end_src

** Add executables to exec-path

This ensures Emacs can find essential executables by using whereis to locate them and
adding them to the exec-path. I need this on NixOS because everything else I tried
didn't work.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/add-executable-to-exec-path (executable)
    "Find EXECUTABLE using whereis and add its directory to exec-path."
    (let* ((whereis-output (shell-command-to-string (concat "whereis " executable)))
           (exec-file-path (when (string-match (concat "/" "[^ ]+" "/" executable) whereis-output)
                            (match-string 0 whereis-output))))
      (when exec-file-path
        (let ((exec-dir (file-name-directory exec-file-path)))
          (add-to-list 'exec-path exec-dir)
          (message "Added %s to exec-path" exec-dir)))))

  (defun my/add-essential-executables-to-exec-path ()
    "Add essential executables (git, node, sh, ispell, aider) to exec-path."
    (interactive)
    (dolist (executable '("git" "node" "sh" "ispell" "aider"))
      (my/add-executable-to-exec-path executable)))

** Fix lsp mode for PHP
[2025-06-02 Mon 14:53]

Even though I configured lsp for PHP, I always manually have to ~M-x lsp~ when
opening a PHP buffer. This snipped fixes it by enabling lsp mode after a buffer
became visible (it doesn't work to add it to the php-mode-hook, likely because
that is too early).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-enable-lsp-for-visible-php-buffers (frame)
    "Enable LSP mode for visible PHP buffers that don't have it active."
    (dolist (window (window-list frame))
      (with-current-buffer (window-buffer window)
        (when (and (derived-mode-p 'php-mode)
                   (not (bound-and-true-p lsp-mode)))
          (lsp-deferred)))))

* Org-Edna extensions
[2025-04-02 Wed 10:39]

This lets me evaluate a named org-babel block when a heading is set to DONE.

Add a trigger to a heading like this:
#+begin_example
:TRIGGER: self eval-babel!("office-hour-stats")
#+end_example

And have a named babel block in the content.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-edna-action/eval-babel! (last-entry block-name)
    "Execute the named Babel source block specified by BLOCK-NAME.
  LAST-ENTRY is the marker for the current heading."
    (save-excursion
      (with-current-buffer (marker-buffer last-entry)
        (goto-char last-entry)
        (org-babel-goto-named-src-block block-name)
        (org-babel-execute-src-block))))

* Provide statement (needs to be at the end!)

The provide statement must match the symbol you use in require
It should be the last line of executable code in your file
The feature name (symbol) should match your filename: =my-org-extensions.el= provides ~'my-org-extensions~

** Why This System Exists

This prevents infinite loops and ensures modules are only loaded once. When you require a feature:

- If it's already loaded, Emacs does nothing
- If not loaded, Emacs finds and loads the file that provides it
- The provide statement marks it as successfully loaded

Without the provide statement, Emacs doesn't know that your file actually provides the requested feature, so require fails.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'my-org-extensions)
#+end_src
