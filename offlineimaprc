#
# Note: be care to configure the 'remotehost' line with the domain name defined
# in the certificate. E.g., if you trust your provider and want to use the
# certificate it provides on a shared server. Otherwise, OfflineIMAP will stop
# and say that the domain is not named in the certificate.

# SSL CA Cert(s) to verify the server cert against (optional).
# No SSL verification is done without this option. If it is
# specified, the CA Cert(s) need to verify the Server cert AND
# match the hostname (* wildcard allowed on the left hand side)
# The certificate should be in PEM format.
#
# Tilde and environment variable expansions will be performed.
#
# Special value OS-DEFAULT makes OfflineIMAP to automatically
# determine system-wide location of standard trusted CA roots file
# for known OS distributions and use the first bundle encountered
# (if any).  If no system-wide CA bundle is found, OfflineIMAP
# will refuse to continue; this is done to prevent creation
# of false security expectations ("I had configured CA bundle,
# thou certificate verification shalt be present").
#
# You can also use fingerprint verification via cert_fingerprint.
# See below for more verbose explanation.
#
# get with:
# $ openssl s_client -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -connect ${hostname}:imaps -showcerts | perl -ne 'print if /BEGIN/../END/; print STDERR if /return/' > $sslcacertfile
#sslcacertfile = uni-imap.cert

########## Passwords

# There are six ways to specify the password for the IMAP server:
#
# 1. No password at all specified in the config file.
#    If a matching entry is found in ~/.netrc (see netrc (5) for
#    information) this password will be used. Do note that netrc only
#    allows one entry per hostname. If there is no ~/.netrc file but
#    there is an /etc/netrc file, the password will instead be taken
#    from there. Otherwise you will be prompted for the password when
#    OfflineIMAP starts when using a UI that supports this.
